#### [USDRL: Unified Skeleton-Based Dense Representation Learning with Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.09220v2), [Code](https://github.com/wengwanjiang/USDRL), AAAI2025

We propose a simple yet effective method named Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning (USDRL) that learns dense representations through multi-grained feature decorrelation, demonstrating the feasibility of feature decorrelation in skeleton-based dense representations learning.

#### [Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.17210v2), [Code](https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main), AAAI2025

We introduce a novel framework that seamlessly integrates reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods for video anomaly detection, leveraging the strengths of both approaches. We propose a Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which incorporates both conditioned motion and conditioned embedding in a diffusion-based model.

### [Training-Free Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13795), [Code](https://github.com/Chaolei98/FreeZAD), [Project](https://chaolei98.github.io/FreeZAD/)
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the problem of training-free ZSTAD. We propose FreeZAD, a training-free approach for ZSTAD, which effectively leverages the generalization capabilities of ViL models to detect unseen activities. We introduce a simple yet effective TTA method that extends FreeZAD and enhances its performance by enabling adaptation to a video sequence without supervision.
